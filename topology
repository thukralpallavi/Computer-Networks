Topology studies properties of spaces that are invariant under any continuous deformation.
It is sometimes called "rubber-sheet geometry" because the objects can be stretched and contracted like rubber,
but cannot be broken. For example, a square can be deformed into a circle without breaking it, but a figure 8 cannot.

In mathematics, topology is concerned with the properties of a geometric object that are preserved under continuous deformations, 
such as stretching, twisting, crumpling, and bending; that is,
without closing holes, opening holes, tearing, gluing, or passing through itself.
